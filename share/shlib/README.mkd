### shlib ###

I want to support simple modules for bash code, with both dependency declaration and inline documentation

## my requirements
*   _simple_and_obvious__

    I don't want to have to reread documentation when I think to add something. The simplest route should be the right route.

*   _clean_

    I don't ever want to reload code unless I explicitly request to do so.

*   _lightweight_

    Prefer functions; aim for zero process creation whenever possible.

*   _unobtrusive_

    DO NOT pollute the ALLCAPS region of the environment variable namespace.

*   _portable_

    It's using bash, so that's a restriction, but it should run on Darwin's bash, common Linux flavors, cygwin, etc.

*   _robust_

    Absence of this code should cause as little disruption as possible.

*   _lucid_

    Usage of this code should be easy to make clear and readable.

None of the existing toolkits I can find out there have all of these, so it's roll-my-own time.
