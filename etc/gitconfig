#
# About trustExitCode: For a custom merge command, specify whether the exit code of the merge command
#  can be used to determine whether the merge was successful. If this is not set to true then the
#  merge target file timestamp is checked and the merge assumed to have been successful if the file
#  has been updated, otherwise the user is prompted to indicate the success of the merge.
#
# "bcomp" is a symlink in my shell's path; it points to /Applications/Beyond Compare.app/Contents/MacOS/bcomp
#   which is the standard commandline entrypoint into Beyond Compare for OSX.
